## Overview

This is the React front-end starter code you can use to interact with your API. The backend express starter you were provided has authentication built-in. This starter will be ready to work with that authentication. You will use this starter to complete the front-end portion of your capstone.

### Learning Objectives

- Practice building larger applications with React
- Practice building a system architecture for an application
- Practice working with a back-end API
- Practice using a UI component library
- Practice following SCRUM processes and understanding/practicing SCRUM roles
- Practice communicating/working together as a team

## Getting Started...

The design, layout, and component architecture will be up to you. Feel free to leverage the patterns you see in this starter code.

1. Mock out possible pages
2. Break pages out into possible components
3. Discuss at what point will you hit the API, use state, and how components will get the props they need.
4. Discuss and research what UI component library you would like to use and which components you will use. [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) is already included and being used to style the exisiting components.
5. I recommend experimenting with some components to get comfortable with how they work and which components you could use for which parts of your application.

6. Begin creating/using components to establish a general foundation of your app
